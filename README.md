## Introduction

This project provides a tool for farmers to predict the most suitable crops and their expected yields based on specific soil and environmental conditions. The model is trained using a Linear Regression algorithm, which provides a balance of simplicity and effectiveness.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Correlation matrix for feature relationships
- Crop suggestion based on input conditions
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction of crop yields

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
- **Nitrogen (N)**
- **Phosphorus (P)**
- **Potassium (K)**
- **Temperature (Â°C)**
- **Humidity (%)**
- **pH Value**
- **Rainfall (mm)**
- **Crop**
- **Yield**
